# hikerGame

I created a game where you are hiking through the woods and need to avoid the trees! Different types of trees give you different damage points. You can move your hiker character by tilting your device. Sometimes a map appears that you can pick up to regain a little health. 

There is a splash screen, instructions screen, a screen to enter your name and choose your character, the game screen, and a leaderboard screen. The leaderboard saves if you close the app using Cora Data. I used the Navigation Controller for the first time as well. 

You can see a demo of the app here: https://youtu.be/0J-4TatZd_A
